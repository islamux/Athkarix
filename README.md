To update the `README.md` of `@islamux/Athkarix` so it matches the style and structure of the one in `@islamux/voices-of-truth`, I will first draft a new README.md for Athkarix. I will reuse the sections and style, but adapt the content to fit Athkarix, which appears to be an Islamic app (أذكار) based on the current README (in Arabic) and the likely purpose.

Here's a new README draft for `Athkarix`, in the same structure as the "voices-of-truth" project, but tailored for an أذكار (Athkar) application:

````markdown name=README.md
# 📿 Athkarix - تطبيق الأذكار الذكي

## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses local JSON/TypeScript data modules for Athkar and Duas.
- Internationalization via Flutter's localization system (`l10n/`).
- Athkar are displayed and filtered client-side, with dynamic language and theme switching.
- Fully responsive and visually enhanced with Flutter widgets and animations.
- Smart notification system to remind users at the right times.
